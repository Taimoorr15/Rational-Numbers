# Rational-Numbers
This a class for the Rational Numbers.
A rational number is a type of real number, which is in the form of p/q where q is not equal to zero. Any fraction with non-zero denominators is a rational number. Some of the examples of rational numbers are 1/2, 1/5, 3/4, and so on. The number “0” is also a rational number, as we can represent it in many forms such as 0/1, 0/2, 0/3, etc. But, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, etc. are not rational, since they give us infinite values
