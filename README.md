What are Rational Numbers?

In mathematics, a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers:

Rational Number
=
𝑝
𝑞
Rational Number=
q
p
	​


where:

𝑝
p = numerator (integer)

𝑞
q = denominator (integer, and 
𝑞
≠
0
q

=0)

Examples:

1
2
2
1
	​

, 
−
5
3
3
−5
	​

, 
7
7 (yes, integers are also rational numbers because 
7
=
7
1
7=
1
7
	​

)

Key properties for your class:

The denominator can never be 0.

The fraction should ideally be stored in simplest form (e.g., 
4
8
8
4
	​

 becomes 
1
2
2
1
	​

).

You can perform arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and comparisons between rational numbers.

Sign should normally be kept in the numerator (e.g., 
−
1
2
−
2
1
	​

 instead of 
1
−
2
−2
1
	​

)
